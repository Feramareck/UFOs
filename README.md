Analyze UFOs 

## Overview of the analysis: 
The objective of this project is to allow UFO Sightings web page users to be able to use the date, time, city, state, country and shape filters as a way to improve the visualization of data in the dynamic table of the page.

## Results: 
When accessing the UFOs Sighting web page, the first thing we see is the screen in the figure below, which contains some text, a table containing data on alien signal views and the search filters
##
To use the filters, just insert the desired filter in the respective field and click Enter or click with the mouse on any other filter. We can choose any of the filters separately or use them together. The table will automatically list only the rows containing the desired filters.
In the figure below we used only the date (1/4/2010) and shape (light) filters.
##
In this other figure we use all available filters.

## Summary: 
Although the insertion of filters is considered an improvement, to use them it is necessary to have prior knowledge of the data so that they are inserted correctly.  
That said, a recommendation for further development would be to change the filters to dropdown filters where the user can select data only from the data available in the table.  
Another improvement would be to insert a counter of table records, so the user could have more data for analysis.  

The main files that support the UFOs Sighting web page are app.js, index.html and data.js and that are available above.
